## Description

This project is about linear regression.

The goal is to implement functions that compute the linear regression of a set of points and use them in some applications.

The project is divided into three parts:
- one dimension
- general case
- some applications

## Report 

A report is available [here](report.pdf) in french. It is a work in progress.

```bash
make one_dimension
```
```bash

```

Also you can run the application tests:

```
```bash

Some graphs will be saved in the folders indicated, they are the ones used in the report.
